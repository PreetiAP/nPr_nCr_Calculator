Combinations:

	Each of the different groups or selections which can be formed by taking some or all of a number of objects is called a combination.
	
Examples:
	1. Suppose we want to select two out of three boys A, B, C. Then, possible selections are AB, BC and CA.
		Note: AB and BA represent the same selection.
	2. All the combinations formed by a, b, c taking ab, bc, ca.
	3. The only combination that can be formed of three letters a, b, c taken all at a time is abc.
	4. Various groups of 2 out of four persons A, B, C, D are: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.
	5. Note that ab ba are two different permutations but they represent the same combination.
